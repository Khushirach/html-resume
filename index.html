    <h1>Summary</h1>
    <p> 
        I am an experienced Product Manager with over five years of expertise in leading cross-functional teams to deliver innovative solutions that drive business growth and operational efficiency. My work at Value Score Business Solutions LLP and LivLong Life Insurance (IIFL) has focused on market analysis, user experience optimization, and agile project management.

        Key achievements include implementing Zoho Inventory and Books, which led to a 15% revenue increase and a 10% reduction in operational costs, as well as delivering solutions that positively impacted over 20,000 users. I am proficient in using tools like Zoho Suite, JIRA, SQL, and Azure TFS to turn complex business needs into actionable, strategic plans.
        
        I am currently seeking Product Manager opportunities in Mumbai, where I can leverage my skills to contribute to the success of forward-thinking companies.
